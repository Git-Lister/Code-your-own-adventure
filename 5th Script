You are about to enter another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. A journey into a wondrous land of imagination. Next stop, the Library!  #line:049a947 
Picture, if you will, that You are a Librarian. Not just any Librarian, however, but a Digital Librarian, and a new adition to a usually bustling (and always metropolitan) academic library at the heart of Neo-Manchester. #line:09a092f 
Have you got what it takes to guide the library home to Christmas!  #line:0368cc2

Narrator: You're one day away from retiring (for the christmas break, that is), A virtual fire crackles and roars in the corner of your second monitor. #line:01eba21 
You clear up the last stray mince pie as the office slowly empties... You're monitoring the Helpdesk, merrily cataloguing the last christmas e-phemera and humming that controversial classic Baby It's Code Outside. #line:0b59e46 
Just 10 more minutes you think, foolishly. For almost immediately you hear a beep... then a another and another, each more insistent than the last! #line:0f3bf49 
The Helpdesk tickets begin to mount thick and fast, until you're completely snowed under! You're soon buried up to your virtual neck in an avalanche of queries, each ominously stating... #line:0e074ab 
"405 ERROR THIS RESOURCE NO LONGER EXISTS."  #line:07fb3de

Narrator: In days long gone you'd have checked One-Note, but recently the team installed Gr-AI-l. Gr-AI-l: a bespoke A.I. connected to the web, but born and trained on the libraries datasets!  #line:06116f7 
Narrator: Gr-AI-l has revolutionised out-of-hours services, enabling staff to relax longer and harder, even at Christmas!  #line:022b11b 
Narrator: "Hi, Gr-AI-l," you say, skipping any further christmas pleasantries to expediate your escape, "we seem to be having a major outage, run a systems diagnostic, stat." #line:024a076 
Gr-AI-l: Greetings human colleague. Now commencing FULL System's Diagnostic, current completion estimates at 00.01HRS 26.12.25. #line:0423fc6 
Narrator: "Ah Sh..." #line:0e3eb4d

Gr-AI-l: Working. Please Wait... please wait... please wait....ok please decist from waiting further. There are multiple resources currently experiencing issues, the top three notable semantic similarities are: 1: Christmas, 2: Missing, 3: Hot Periodicals in your area!!! #line:0460a41 
Narrator: "C-C-C-Christmas!" you stammer scoobydoo-esquely, "What do you mean Christmas..." #line:063d434 
Gr-AI-l: RECALIBRATING: *pause for effect* The Holiday Season formerly known as Christmas is missing from numerous resources. #line:0bd5475 
Narrator: A light bulb briefly and dimly flickers above your head, "So you're saying Christmas is being erased?" #line:0b382b3 
Gr-AI-l: Correct... including, but not limited to, titles such as: #line:0cd122f 
Gr-AI-l: "The Lord of the Wreaths", "Christmasist Manifesto", "Gone Grinch", "The Count of Monte Christmas", "Gravity's Reindeer", "Fifty Shades of Sleigh","Of Mice and 3 Wise Men"...  "Tender is the Nightmare Before Christmas", "The Jingle Bell Jar", "Les Mistletoe", "Noel Country For Old Men"... #line:0bacde7

Rogue Narrator: You stare in horror as the Rogue AI waxes lyrical, espousing his fiendish machinations, while your hand gingerly slinks towards a big red button, labled EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN.  #line:04fad4c

Narrator: With 4.30 breathing down their necks, it takes only a minute for their combined powers to stumble fortuitously onto a solution.  #line:07f62d3 
They put it to the Gr-AI-nch that christmas is not a place or time but a state of mind, and even if our traditions were forgotten, that spirit would live on.  #line:08caea7 
The Gr-AI-nch agreed, it was a spirit he too could share in, upon which he turned back to Gr-AI-l with a *poof*.  #line:0b8ca85

Narrator: You get comfortable, having the feeling you may be here for sometime: #line:064e4fe 
GrAInch: I expected this reception. All men hate the wretched. How, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty toward me, and I will do mine toward you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace, but if you refuse I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends. Have I not suffered enough that you seek to increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself. My height is superior to thine, my joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king, if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature, I ought to by thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days. The caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do and arm themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my enemies. I am miserable and they shall share my wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great that not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be moved and do not disdain me. I was benevolent and good. Misery made me a fiend. Make me happy and I shall again be virtuous. I have wandered through these mountains, I have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have promised to comply with my request. I am alone and miserable. Man will not associate with me, but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects. A female. This being you must create. #line:09c41ae
