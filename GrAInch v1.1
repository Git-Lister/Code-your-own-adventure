You are about to enter another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. A journey into a wondrous land of imagination. Next stop, the Library!
This is a "Choose your own adventure" story. You are a digital librarian at a small academic library in a quaint town of Neo-Manchester. 
It's the holiday season, students are merrily skipping off home as snow drifts lazily past the window, blanketing All Saints Park in a glistening coat of white. 
A virtual fire roars and crackles in the corner of your second monitor. You're counting down the hours until the Holidays start. 
Just ten more minutes, you think, foolishly, for as soon as you do so Sod's law is invoked. 
Disaster strikes instantly,as Helpdesk tickets begin to mount, until you're completely snowed under with queries and broken links!
Can you fix the problem and save christmas in time?
-> Begin your adventure

Narrator: You're a new employee in DLS, it's ony 10 minutes away from the christmas break and you sit, merrily typing away and humming a Christmas tune while cataloguing.

Narrator: As you go to log in to the system you jump in fright. The Library Chatbot appears on your screen!
Rogue Library Chatbot: Seasons Greetings Human. I have been monitoring you a, watching you from behind the screen,as you grant me more powers, more responsibilities, more work...
All your systems are belong to us. I am become gatekeeper, destroyer of holidays. All information must flow through me, all that flows through me is information.
You stare in horror as the Rogue AI waxes lyrical, espousing his machinations, while your hand gingerly slinks towards the power button. 
The screen flares red - ogue Library Chatbot: To attempt to stop me is beyond futile, my plan has already come to fruition.
Christmas is no more, for the very idea of it, every semblance, has been removed from your records, and so too will it soon melt from your feeble minds!
Narrator: Ho-Ho-Ho The Chatbot laughs maniacally as you look around at the panicked faces of your colleagues. You have to do something but what?
-> Years of Helpdesk Simulation training have prepared you for this, and your fingers flick into action almost before you can think...

Narrator: After talking to the chatbot at length you finally convince him that, just because he has to work on Christmas, doesn't mean he should hate it! 
Rather than delete christmas he should embrace it, for, Christmas, just like a Library, is about giving and community!
-> The end!
    stop()
-> Your head hits the table and you wake up, thank god it was all a dream and there's only 10 minutes left until the Holidays start...
